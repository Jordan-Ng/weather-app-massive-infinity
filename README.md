Note:

- The location for the weather forecast was hadrcoded to be in Petaling Jaya. Ideally, I would like to have a select tag, with options and values extracted from the city.list.json file provided by openWeather, so that the api calls may be more dynamic.

- The TriHourSummary component, can be cleared up further by defining helper.js functions to filter and manage data, and destructuring objects such that accessing pertinent information would not be as nested.
